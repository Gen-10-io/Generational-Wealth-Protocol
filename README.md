# 🌌 Generational Wealth Protocol (GWP)  
**Seed Wealth for Humanity's Interstellar Future**

The **Generational Wealth Protocol (GWP)** is an open-source project that enables individuals to invest Bitcoin for their descendants across **10 generations**. Using a halving mechanism, the invested Bitcoin is distributed sustainably, ensuring wealth reaches even the most distant heirs. As humanity expands across the universe, GWP aims to provide a financial foundation for future generations, wherever they may be.

## 🚀 What is GWP?
GWP leverages Bitcoin and blockchain technology to create a decentralized, trustless system for generational wealth transfer. Here’s the gist:
- **Invest**: Lock Bitcoin into a smart contract.
- **Halve & Distribute**: Each generation inherits half the remaining Bitcoin, split evenly among descendants.
- **Access**: Descendants claim their share using cryptographic keys and lineage verification.

**Example**: Invest 1 BTC today → Your children share 0.5 BTC → Grandchildren share 0.25 BTC → ... → 10th generation shares ~0.001 BTC.

## 🔑 Key Features
- **Halving Mechanism**: Ensures sustainable wealth distribution over 10 generations.
- **Smart Contract**: Automates distribution with time-based or descendant-based triggers.
- **Access Control**: Uses cryptographic keys and decentralized identity verification.
- **Security**: Multi-signature wallets and future-proof cryptography (e.g., quantum-resistant).
- **Interstellar-Ready**: Designed for humanity’s expansion, accounting for communication delays and universal access.

## 🛠️ How It Works
1. **Investment**: You lock Bitcoin into a smart contract.
2. **Distribution**: 
   - **Generation 1 (children)**: Shares 0.5 BTC.
   - **Generation 2 (grandchildren)**: Shares 0.25 BTC.
   - Continues until **Generation 10**.
3. **Claiming**: Descendants use inherited keys and prove lineage via zero-knowledge proofs or decentralized attestation.
4. **Security**: Funds are protected by multi-sig wallets and community audits.

## 🌠 Why GWP Matters
Humanity’s future is interstellar. Over the next 250–300 years, we’ll colonize new worlds. GWP ensures:
- **Long-Term Wealth**: Descendants inherit resources to thrive, no matter where they are.
- **Universal Access**: Wealth transfer works across planets and star systems.
- **Open-Source Ethos**: Built by and for the community, fostering collaboration across generations.

## 📜 Implementation Roadmap
- **Phase 1 (6–12 months)**: Design smart contract and halving mechanism.
- **Phase 2 (12–18 months)**: Simulate distributions and conduct security audits.
- **Phase 3 (Year 2)**: Launch open-source repo for community contributions.
- **Phase 4 (Years 3+)**: Deploy live investments and monitor over decades.

## 🤝 Get Involved
